      <h1 class="my-4">Welcome to VNUK Airlines</h1>

VNUK Airlines is proud to be one of the youngest global airlines to serve all six continents, and thanks to our customers’ response to our offerings, we are also the world’s fastest-growing airline. We connect more than 160 destinations on the map every day, with a fleet of the latest-generation aircraft, and an unrivalled level of service from our home and hub, the Five-star airport, Da Nang International Airport in Danang, the city of Vietnam.

Travel today involves a mix of short, medium and long-haul segments, with more people travelling than ever before. With the breadth of network coverage today, virtually no destination is unreachable. This is why the commitment to service is paramount; as our guests are travelling farther and more frequently than ever before, the experience on board is an important part of the journey itself.

Since our launch in 1997,VNUK Airlines has earned many awards and accolades, becoming one of an elite group of airlines worldwide to have earned a 5-star rating by Skytrax. Voted Airline of the Year by Skytrax in 2011, 2012, 2015 and most recently in 2017, VNUK Airlines has won the confidence of the travelling public. We have accomplished these goals by focusing on the details – how we run the business, and how you experience our airline.

My goal is to make VNUK Airlines your airline of choice, offering the flights you want to the destinations you need. That drives this team of more than 46,000 professionals every day, and will continue to motivate us to make VNUK Airlines your only airline.

On behalf of everyone at VNUK Airlines, we look forward to welcoming you on board, and let us Go Places Together.

Thank you.
