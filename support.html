                <p>– Baggage Tips:</p>
                • It’s always helpful to personalize your baggage with stickers or tags. You can also tag your baggage with your name and contact information so you can find your baggage more easily after your flight.</p>
                • We recommend that you pack your belongings in bags that are designed for travel to avoid damage to your luggage or its contents during transport.</p>
                • In order to safeguard your property and prevent any losses, damages or delays, Vietnam Airlines would like to remind you not to pack any fragile, perishable, valuable, or important personal items in your checked baggage.</p>
                • Any item that exceeds weight requirements and/or exceeds the maximum size (width + height + depth) mentioned above may be rejected.</p>
                • In addition, we recommend that each piece of your checked baggage not exceed 32kg to avoid injury to porters, especially for customers traveling to and from Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Sri Lanka, and the United Kingdom. This is in accordance with local occupational safety rules.</p>
                • The Free Baggage Allowance might vary for different carriers. Please consider this if you are connecting to/from another carrier or if you are taking any Vietnam Airlines code sharing flight that is operated by other airlines. Please refer to the Interline Baggage Rules for more details.</p>

                      • Check-in timing also depends on each different individual airport and carrier.</p>
                      • Passengers need to arrive at the airport early to have enough time for check-in, security check, and immigration procedures.</p>
                      • Depending on your fare conditions, a failure to check-in on time may also result in:</p>
                      • Making your ticket invalid for travel or becoming non-refund in case there are restrictions on changes. You will need to make a new booking and purchase a new ticket.</p>
                      • Paying change fee, and/or fares difference for the new applicable fare.</p>
                      • Due to potential traffic delays, check-in time and security screening,  you are recommended to be at the airport at least 60 minutes before departure of domestic flights and 120 minutes before departure of international flights. The handing of stand by passengers bases on the method “first comes, first serve” in each priority level.</p>
